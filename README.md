# CSUF Scheduler

A full-stack workforce scheduling platform for university student staff. Built with Flask, React Native/Expo, and Google OR-Tools to automate constraint-based schedule generation — cutting schedule creation from 4+ hours of manual work to under 30 seconds.

## The Problem

Scheduling 20+ student staff members across overlapping shifts, certification requirements, and availability windows was done manually with spreadsheets — taking supervisors 4+ hours per week and still producing conflicts. There was no audit trail, no swap workflow, and no way to enforce labor policies consistently.

## What This Builds

A production-grade scheduling platform where supervisors configure constraints once and the optimizer generates a policy-compliant schedule in seconds. Staff submit availability and swap requests through a mobile app; supervisors approve through the same interface. Every action is logged.

---

## Key Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Schedule generation time | 4+ hours (manual) | < 30 seconds |
| Schedule feasibility rate | ~70% (conflicts common) | 95%+ |
| Supervisor scheduling effort | Baseline | ~60% reduction |
| Constraint violations | Manual enforcement | Zero (hard constraints guaranteed) |

---

## Optimization Approach

The scheduling engine (`backend/app/services/scheduler/engine.py`) uses the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** — a constraint programming model over Boolean decision variables.

```
assignments[(employee_id, date, template_id)] ∈ {0, 1}
```

**Hard constraints** (always satisfied):
- Employee availability windows (submitted per day)
- Maximum weekly hours per employee
- Minimum rest hours between consecutive shifts
- Patrol/lockup certification requirements
- Approved leave exclusions
- Trainee–FTO pairing rules

**Soft constraints** (minimized in objective function):
- Fair hour distribution across all employees (weighted penalty ×1000)
- Workload rotation to prevent the same staff covering every weekend
- Understaffed shift minimization

The solver returns `OPTIMAL` or `FEASIBLE` status; infeasible slots are flagged with the specific constraint that blocked assignment.

**Role hierarchy:** `admin` → `supervisor` → `FTO` → `student/trainee`

Each role sees a scoped view: admins manage the system, supervisors generate/approve schedules, FTOs are paired with trainees, students submit availability and swap requests.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) PostgreSQL — SQLite works out of the box for local dev

### Backend

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt

# 3. Configure environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — set DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY

# 4. Run database migrations
cd backend
flask db upgrade

# 5. Start the dev server
cd ..
python scripts/run_dev.py
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:5000` · Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/apidocs/`

### Mobile App

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start --localhost
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go, or press `w` for browser preview. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `mobile/.env` to point at your backend.

## Generating a Schedule

1. Log in as `supervisor` or `admin`
2. Navigate to **Schedule Config** and set the date range, shift templates, and max weekly hours
3. Tap **Generate** — the CP-SAT solver runs and returns a schedule within seconds
4. Review flagged shifts (understaffed slots with the blocking constraint shown)
5. Tap **Apply** to publish the schedule to all staff

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

Linting:

```bash
black --check backend
isort --check-only backend
flake8 backend/app
```

---

## Deployment

The project ships with a `render.yaml` for one-click Render deployment and a `docker-compose.prod.yml` for self-hosted setups.

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for environment variable reference, migration steps, and rollback procedures.

## About

Built as a capstone project for CSUF, replacing a manual spreadsheet-based process used by the university's student workforce scheduling team.
